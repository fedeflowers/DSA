    "The data engineers at Amazon are working on partitioning their server chains. There is a linear chain of `n` servers numbered from `1` to `n`, where the cost parameter associated with the `i`th server is represented by the array `cost[i]`. These servers need to be partitioned into exactly `k` different server chains. The cost of partitioning a server chain `servers[i:j]` is defined as `cost[i] + cost[j]`. The total cost is the sum of the partitioning cost of each server chain.\n",
